## Abstract
This study tracks thermal adaptation across eight genetically diverse Saccharomyces yeast species. Key findings include species-specific adaptation strategies and the interplay between genetic diversity and thermal tolerance.

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results:
1. Download the repository.
2. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder using R version 4.3.1.
3. Refer to the README for specific details.
