# Thermal Performance Curves (TPCs) evolution in the *Saccharomyces* genus

This repository contains the scripts used in the analysis and generation of results for the paper “*The evolution of thermal performance curves in response to rising temperature across the model genus yeast*”, published in "under revision".

## Description
This study adds a powerful experimental evolution angle to climate change research by tracking thermal adaptation to relevant global warming scenarios in real time, across hundreds of generations. Evolutionary shifts in thermal performance curves (TPCs) in response to rising temperatures across eight genetically diverse Saccharomyces yeast species revealed that adaptive responses to climate change are highly species-specific. Heat-tolerant and cold-tolerant species showed distinct adaptive strategies, consistent with either "hotter is wider" or generalist "jack of all temperatures is a master of none" patterns. Our findings reveal the complex interplay between genetic diversity and thermal tolerance evolution, and stress the importance to account for both inter- and intra-species genetic variation when forecasting climate impacts on biodiversity.

The analyses were performed using R version 4.3.1.
